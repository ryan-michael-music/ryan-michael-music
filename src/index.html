        <p>
        A musician since elementary school, Ryan Michael has been taking his hard
        rock inspired upbringing to different scenes throughout the NJ/PA area for years.
        His indie-rock band RMLive consists of a rotation of members based out of Manayunk, 
        Philadelphia, and played their debut show at the Grape Room. Ryan and his band have
        played different venues in various forms, including The Fire, The Rusty Nail,
        Khyber Pass Pub, and The Crown Hookah Lounge.
        </p>

        Ryan has also released a solo single "Chains", and the live track "What I'm Afraid Of" with 
        RMLive, both of which are available for playback below. He will soon be releasing the band's 
        first single "Stay."
